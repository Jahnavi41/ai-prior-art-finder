US-4772931-A,"A semiconductor photodetector is formed of interdigitated, metal-semiconductor-metal electrodes disposed on a surface of semi-insulating semiconductor material, gallium arsenide. Radiation such as infra-red or visible light is converted to an electric current flowing between the electrodes upon application of a bias voltage between the electrodes. A Schottky barrier at the junction of each electrode surface and the semiconductor surface limits current flow to that produced by photons of sufficient frequency, or energy, to overcome the Schottky barrier. Tunneling of charge carriers of the current under the Schottky barrier, which tunneling results from the entrapment of charge carriers on the semiconductor surface, is inhibited by the production of a doped surface layer upon the foregoing surface between the electrodes to repulse the charge carriers and prevent their entrapment at the surface. The doped surface layer is much thinner than an interaction region of the radiation in the semiconductor material and has sufficiently high resistance to permit the photodetector to function efficiently."

Single trimers of these proteins lack the full stimulatory efficacy of the natural membrane forms of these proteins in many cases.

US-5737371-A,"An apparatus and method are provided for detecting and correcting data stream misalignments during read back of data in an optical drive unit. In a dual PLL system, after a data stream is divided into separate positive and negative data streams, correlations are made between the transitions in the even nibbles of a sync mark and the transitions in the odd nibbles. Proper and improper alignments can be detected. The resync marks are also employed to determine whether the two data streams are misaligned and, if they are, by how much. While the position of an alignment bit within a resync mark can be detected, realigning the data streams based upon this position can result in small defects causing false alignment and a continuous error until the next resync. Consequently, the present invention employs other bits in the resync mark and in the adjoining customer data field to validate the misalignment independent of the alignment bit itself. Moreover, if a suspected misalignment is not validated by the other bits, information about the misalignment is stored in a memory and the next resync mark is examined. Once any misalignment is validated, a realignment is performed by gating the positive data stream, with an appropriate delay, through a multiplexor to be OR&#39;d with the negative data stream."

US-2009302717-A1,"The present invention is a brushless electric motor that can be used in high performance applications, such as model airplanes. The rotor assembly, which includes the rotor shaft, encloses a winding core, which is part of a fixed stator assembly. Conducting wire in the armature portion of the stator assembly is wrapped around a set of spokes, extending radially from an inner hub. The spokes are formed from a stack of flat metal laminations, the laminations oriented perpendicular to the rotation axis. The spokes are wrapped with a single layer of copper wire, which is connected to the energy source when the motor is operational. These spokes are long relative to the diameter of the inner hub, leaving V-shaped slots through the winding core.

The maximum gradient value is displayed using a display device, and the position of the photodetector with the maximum gradient value is indicated by an adjacent light source. The gradient of an automobile headlamp may thus be found easily, assisting in headlamp positioning during headlamp and vehicle manufacture."

US-5866819-A,"A non-destructive method and apparatus for determining the thickness of individual layers of different materials in a multilayer structure particularly useful in analyzing the layers in a multilayer plastic fuel tank, utilizes a constant and relatively high frequency ultrasonic pulse transmitted into the multilayer structure and records the time when interference pulses are received to determine the thickness of the individual layers in the multilayer structure. The interference pulses are generated at the interface between adjacent layers of sufficiently different materials and thus, the time between interference pulses is a function of the amount of time needed for the ultrasonic pulse to pass through a layer of material. The duration between reflected pulses is called the transmission time which is the time for the ultrasonic frequency to originally pass through the material and also the time for the reflected pulse to bounce back to the transducer and is thus equal to twice the time needed for the ultrasonic pulse to pass through the layer. Therefore, the thickness of a layer within a multilayer structure can be readily computed as one-half of the transmission time multiplied by the speed of sound through the material comprising that layer."

US-5454009-A,"A satellite communications system for dispersing energy over a wide bandwidth includes a transmitter, a communication link, and a receiver. The transmitter takes a digital data signal and modulates that signal at a prescribed carrier frequency. The modulated digital data signal is then spread over M adjacent digital channels (M≧2 and being an integer multiple of 2), each channel containing the same information, to disperse the energy over a wide frequency range. The spectral bandwidth of the adjacent digital channels is chosen with compressed spacing to conserve bandwidth. Next, the spread modulated data signal is transmitted via the communication link to the receiver. In particular, a waveform generator at the transmitter generates a phase-aligned multichannel frequency diversity waveform according to a data clock at a predetermined phase relationship to the digital data. At the receiver, the spread modulated data signal received is mixed with a despreading waveform generated in a similar manner to the waveform spectrum generated at the transmitter to recover the modulated data signal.

The invention employs three main elements: a source of coherent light, such as a VCSEL, laser diode or He—Ne laser; an etched channel of capillary dimensions in a substrate for reception of a sample to be analyzed; and a photodetector for detecting laser light reflected off of the channel. The laser source generates an unfocused laser beam that is incident on the etched channel. A unique multi-pass optical configuration is inherently created by the channel characteristics, and is based on the interaction of the unfocused laser beam and the curved surface of the channel, that allows RI measurements in small volumes at high sensitivity. The entire device, including the laser and the photodetector can be formed on a single microchip. The detector has numerous applications, including universal/RI detection for CE (capillary electrophoresis), CEC (capillary electrochromatography) and FIA, physiometry, cell sorting/detection by scatter, ultra micro calorimetry, flow rate sensing and temperature sensing."

US-5648968-A,"A transmitting system (80) is disclosed which includes several antennas (801-803) providing a plurality of antenna beams. The transmit signal from transmitter 81 is sent to the plurality of antennas via routing circuitry (82). The transmit signal is divided into two or more identical signals, each delayed by a selected amount. The particular antenna to which the undelayed signal, the first delayed signal and each other delayed signal is sent is selected for any instant depending on control signals provided by control (83). Control (83), in turn, could operate from a number of factors, one being the relative strengths of the received signals at each of the antennas for that particular channel. The amount of delay could, if desired, also be controlled by control (83)."

US-6749171-B2,"A rustication for preparing reveal bands in a precast panel surface. The rustication is made from a one piece elongate body of extruded foam and comprises an upper surface, a lower surface and laterally-spaced sidewall surfaces that extend between the upper and lower surfaces. The lower surface defines a base plane. One or more downward-extending edges that project below the lower surface base plane are included such that they can bend under the application of a load, such as when concrete is poured around it to form the precast panel. Under such a load, the edge scrapes along the top of a panel-forming surface so that an enhanced sealing engagement between the panel-forming surface and the rustication is effected. The rustication can further include a plurality of longitudinally-spaced apertures that extend from the upper surface to the lower surface to facilitate the securing of the rustication to the panel-forming surface, thereby precluding rustication shift once the concrete is pouted."
